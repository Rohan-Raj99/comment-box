    <h3>Test case of Project</h3>
    <p>1.The page is always launched with one static textarea at the top and an add button which allows the user to add comments.</p>
    <p>2.The page is always launched with one static textarea at the top and an add button which allows the user to add comments.</p>
    <p>3.The page is always launched with one static textarea at the top and an add button which allows the user to add comments.</p>
    <p>4.Every comment added will have a reply, a like and a delete button.</p>
    <p>5.A reply button will launch a new textarea below the parent comment, allowing the user to either add a reply or cancel the addition.</p>
    <p>6.A like button will keep incrementing the number of likes on the respective comment at every click.</p>
    <p>7.A delete button will delete the entire comment chain.</p>
    <p>8.Comments can be chained resembling a tree-like structure wherein every child comment will be aligned some pixels left to the parent comment.</p>
    <p>9.Comments once added should be persisted on page re-load â€” this is an enhancement, it can be attended to in the end if you have time.</p>
